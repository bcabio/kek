Kek: An Interpreted Esoteric Language

### But Why
Cuz why not. That's why.

Well what can I do with it?!?
------
You can assign variables with this syntax
```
var_name kek value
```

So it'll look like
```
var1 kek 3
var2 kek true
```

Pretty simple right?

But wait, you can print too?!?
------
Hell yeah you can

```
(var1)
```

This will print `3` from the example above

Are there functions tho?
------
Of course there are! This wouldn't be a language without functions, right?

```
lol func_name (param1, param2, param3) {
  function_body
}
```
This is how you would declare a function named `func_name` using the keyword `lol` with parameters `param1`, `param2`, and `param3`
